# Reunify – Alumni Networking & Job Referral Portal

## 1. Project Overview

Reunify is a full-stack web application designed to connect college alumni with current students through a structured job referral and networking system.

Many students struggle to find job referrals and guidance, while alumni are often willing to help but lack a proper platform to connect with students. Reunify aims to bridge this gap by providing a centralized portal where alumni can post job opportunities and students can request referrals in an organized and transparent manner.

The system focuses mainly on backend design, role-based access control, and structured referral workflows.


## 2. Scope of the Project

The application will support three main user roles:

- Student  
- Alumni  
- Admin  

The platform will allow verified alumni to post job opportunities. Students can browse jobs, apply for them, and request referrals. Alumni can review applications and decide whether to approve or reject referral requests. Admins will manage and moderate the system.

The scope includes:

- Secure authentication and authorization  
- Profile management for students and alumni  
- Job posting and management  
- Referral request workflow  
- Application tracking system  
- Admin moderation features  

The project focuses on building a clean backend architecture using proper software engineering principles such as separation of concerns, modular design, and object-oriented programming.
